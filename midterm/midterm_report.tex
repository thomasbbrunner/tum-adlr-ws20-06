% Midterm Report

% Your milestone report should be 1 - 2 (max) pages and answer the following questions:
% 1. What has been done so far? (tools decided on, implementations, overview on methods, â€¦)
% 2. First Results (e.g., some raw plots)
% (no explicit introduction, because you described your topic already in the proposal)

% The milestone report must report on at least one experiment that you have done since the proposal. This experiment does not need to be successful, but you should have attempted something. If it did not work as expected, you should briefly discuss why. You are encouraged to include a plot or figure.

% The format for the report has to be the standard IEEE conference format: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html
