\maketitle

We want to study Invertible Neural Networks \cite{Ardizzone2018} and compare them with other existing model architectures like conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAE) \cite{Sohn2015} or conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) \cite{Mehdi2018}.\\

After setting up the architectures we want to evaluate these models based on the simple 2D manipulator.
Our ideas for possible future contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item scaling up the simple 2D manipulator example to 3D space and analyze the suitability of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) \cite{Gretton2008}
    \item replace MMD by other methods for comparing two probability distributions or by a trainable discriminator
    \item study more complex inverse problems from real-world data
    \item path planning ...
\end{itemize}
