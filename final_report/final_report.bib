	abstract = {Recent work demonstrated that flow-based invert-ible neural networks are promising tools for solving ambiguous inverse problems. Following up on this, we investigate how ten invertible archi-tectures and related models fare on two intuitive, low-dimensional benchmark problems, obtaining the best results with coupling layers and simple autoencoders. We hope that our initial efforts inspire other researchers to evaluate their invertible architectures in the same setting and put forth additional benchmarks, so our evaluation may eventually grow into an official community challenge.},

	abstract = {In this paper, Multilayer Feedforward Networks are applied to the robot inverse kinematic problem. The networks are
trained with endeffector position and joint angles. After training, performance is measured by having the network
generate joint angles for arbitrary endeffector trajectories. A 3-degree-of- freedom (DOF) spatial manipulator is used for
the study, it is found that neural networks provide a simple and effective way to both model the manipulator inverse
kinematics and circumvent the problems associated with algorithmic solution methods.},
